\section{Introduction}

%Subnautica reference why VR is awesome, some shit like that
Adventure games play an essential role in game development, 
as the genre has influenced many of today's games, such as \textit{Starfield} \cite{starfield},
and can be dated back decades, all the way to the infamous game \textit{The Secret of Monkey Island} \cite{monkey}.
Since adventure games combine several traits such as exploration, storytelling and puzzle solving, several sub-genres have developed over the years to differentiate and classify the numerous games.
One of these sub-genres is called \textbf{Walking Simulator}, which explicitly focuses on exploring the game world and its narrative \cite{adventure}.
\textit{Abyssal Enigma} is a first-person underwater exploration game with horror elements and can therefore best be described as a swimming simulator 
(as it literally offers depth in the form of free movement in a 3D environment).
%GRL split in 2 parts -> ISPN and VR port
This GRL is divided into two parts:
The first part was the creation of the game - \textit{Abyssal Enigma} - as part of the university course \textit{Interactive Stories and Playable Narratives (ISPN)}, 
a cooperation between the Julius-Maximilians-Universität (JMU) and the Technische Hochschule Würzburg (THW),
and the development by 6 students (including myself)\footnote{for more information see \ref{Sec:Acknowledgement}}. 
As the name of the course suggests, the game focuses heavily on narrative and can be summarized as follows:

\begin{quote}
    You play Charlie, an underwater researcher investigating the mysterious death of his mentor.
    Dive deeper to explore the scheming of the Subnautical Research Institute.
\end{quote} 

In the second part, I  reworked the game - \textit{Abyssal Enigma Dive In Edition} - to make it playable in virtual reality (VR).
Since it's not uncommon for exploration games to get a VR port at a later date, as \textit{Subnautica} \cite{Subnautica} proved, 
which incidentally served as the biggest inspiration for this project.
Both the desktop version and the VR port can be downloaded and played at
\url{https://miggli.itch.io/abyssal-enigma}.

In the following section \ref{Sec:Game} we focus on the development of the desktop version of the game, 
especially on the key components such as the player character or the O2 system.
In the \ref{Sec:VR} section, we go into the necessary steps to convert the desktop version into a functional VR version 
and focus on the most important challenges, such as the player character or the user interface (UI).
In the \ref{Sec:Performance} section, the VR version is briefly evaluated in terms of its performance.
Finally, in section \ref{Sec:ConcFuture} we conclude our work in the form of insights and potential future work.

\section{The game development}
\label{Sec:Game}
%Unreal Engine 5.3
Some talk about the development of the game with course ISPN and what I did do.

\section{VR Port}
\label{Sec:VR}

Unreal VR template
Reworking character
Motion Sickness
Anti motion sickness techniques
UI

\section{Performance}
\label{Sec:Performance}

Short Performance analysis.
BalkenDiagram showing framerate of different levels + 13 ms line above is bad!

\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
\label{Sec:ConcFuture}

UI should be redesigned completetely
More Movement Options explored in 3D VR fyling/swimming
Performance increased with DLSS and optimizations

% \addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
